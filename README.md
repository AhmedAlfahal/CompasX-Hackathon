## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª About the project
Decentralized Voting platform leveraging blockchain technology to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof game streaming competitions. Designed to uphold the integrity of the competition process, VoteChain provides an easy-to-use interface that guarantees the privacy and accuracy of every vote. Voters cast their votes for their favorite players, and if the player they voted for wins, they receive special prizes (NFTs) secured on the blockchain.

## Introduction
- <p style="color: red;">Decentralized Voting platform leveraging blockchain technology to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof game streaming competitions. Designed to uphold the integrity of the competition process, VoteChain provides an easy-to-use interface that guarantees the privacy and accuracy of every vote. Voters cast their votes for their favorite players, and if the player they voted for wins, they receive special prizes secured on the blockchain.</p>


### üîç Importance of Decentralized Voting System:

- <p style="color: red;">Ensuring Fairness and Integrity in Esports Tournaments.</p>

- <p style="color: red;">Enhancing Community Engagement and Trust.</p>

- <p style="color: red;">Improving Efficiency and Accessibility.</p>

- <p style="color: red;"> Strengthening the Esports Ecosystem.</p>


### üí° Implemetation:

### System Architecture
The system integrates multiple components to ensure a seamless and secure voting and rewarding process:
- **Frontend**: User interface built with React.js, providing a responsive and intuitive platform for voting while watching a live stream.
- **Backend**: Server-side logic managed with Node.js and Express.js, handling authentication and API requests.
- **Blockchain**: Solana blockchain for secure and immutable recording of votes.
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity contracts executing voting logic on the blockchain.

### Voting Process

</h1>

1. **Registration and Authentication**:
   - Secure registration and verification of voters.
   - Encrypted log-in to protect voter identity and access.

2. **Casting Votes**:
   - Simple and secure interface for casting votes.
   - Each vote is recorded on the blockchain.

3. **Counting and Results**:
   - Votes are automatically tallied on the blockchain.
   - Results are publicly available and verifiable.

### Security Measures

- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms.
- **Blockchain Security**: Utilizes blockchain‚Äôs immutability and consensus protocols to protect against tampering.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Thorough testing and auditing of smart contracts to ensure security and functionality.

### Testing and Deployment

- **Development Environment**:
  - Truffle and Ganache for local blockchain testing and development.
  - Integration with Metamask for secure user interactions.
  
- **Deployment**:
  - Deployed smart contracts to the Solana test network.
  - Hosted frontend and backend on a scalable cloud service.

### User Experience Enhancements

- **Real-Time Feedback**: Notifications and updates on voting status.
- **Multi-Device Support**: Accessible across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

### Community and Ecosystem Integration

- **Compatibility with Compass**: Designed for easy integration into the Compass esports ecosystem.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling increasing numbers of votes and participants.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
- **React.js**: Ensure you have React.js installed and all it's prerequests.
- **Metamask**: Install the Metamask extension for your browser.
- **Solana Test Network**: Access to a test network like Red Hat for deploying smart contracts.
- **Make**: Ensure you have Make installed to use Makefile files.
- **Docker**: Ensure you have Docker install and all it's prerequests.

### Installation

**1. Clone the project and access the folder**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhmedAlfahal/CompasX-Hackathon.git && cd CompasX-Hackathon
```

# 2. Use Makefile
```bash
  $ sudo make
```
# 3. Open a new tab in the web browser and connect to:
```bash
  localhost:3000
```

## Trade-off: Integrating User Profiles with NFTs

### Enhanced User Engagement: 
   Linking user profiles with NFTs can significantly enhance user engagement by offering tangible rewards tied to voting participation.

### Personalization and Identity: 
   Users can personalize their profiles with unique NFTs, fostering a stronger sense of identity and ownership within the voting platform.

### Monetary Incentives: 
   NFTs associated with user profiles may possess monetary value, potentially incentivizing increased participation and voting activity as users seek to acquire valuable NFTs.
